		<p> I enjoy playing videogames on PC and Xbox in my spare time. My favorite genre is first-person shooters while my favorite setting is dystopian futures. Many of my favorite games are on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One such as Modern Warfare 2 or Halo Reach. On PC, I enjoy playing Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, Rainbow Six Siege, and Overwatch.  </p>

		<p>As mentioned earlier, I play club soccer year-round and I am involved in the Damien soccer team. I began playing soccer when I was younger in order to model my older brother and I eventually fell deep into the sport. When it comes to cheering for proffessionals, I am a big fan of the Los Angeles Galaxy and the United States National Team. </p>

		</div>
<div class="center">
	<p>Philosophy is my favorite subject in academics because it requires you to question the physical world with skepticism that we often fail to do everyday. Unlike other subjects, there is no definite answer to every question and you eventually realize that the world is not as simple as we think it may seem. </p>
